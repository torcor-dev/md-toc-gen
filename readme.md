# md-toc-gen

Creates a table of contents, linking several markdown files in a directory.

It only supports three levels of heading:
1. `#`
2. `##`
3. `###`

It requires correct nesting of headings, h2 needs to have a parent h1 etc.

Use at your own risk.

# Example Table of Contents
1. [Lorem ipsum](testdocs/ch01.md)
2. [Quisque fringilla](testdocs/ch02.md)
3. [Aliquam pretium ac sapien sed ultricies](testdocs/ch03.md)
